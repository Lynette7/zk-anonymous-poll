# Anonymous ZK Poll App

This project demonstrates an anonymous polling application leveraging Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs to ensure unique participation without revealing user identities. It utilizes Noir for ZK circuit development.

## Features (Planned)

- Anonymous Voting: Users can cast votes without revealing their identity.

- Unique Participation: ZK proofs prevent double-voting.

- Real-time Results: Poll results are updated in real-time.

- Scalable Architecture: Designed with clear separation of concerns for future expansion.
